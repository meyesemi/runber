@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: MT529 :"d:\baidunetdiskdownload\runber_gowin_board_sourse\course_prj\course14_watch\watch\src\btn_deb.v":37:4:37:9|Found inferred clock top_watch|clk which controls 128 sequential elements including u_watch_data_gen.u_btn_deb.time_cnt[19]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
