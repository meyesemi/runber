@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: MT529 :"d:\baidunetdiskdownload\runber_gowin_board_sourse\course_prj\course10_seg2\seg_2\src\btn_deb.v":35:4:35:9|Found inferred clock pll|clkout_inferred_clock which controls 52 sequential elements including u_btn_deb.time_cnt[17]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
