@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: MT529 :"d:\baidunetdiskdownload\runber_gowin_board_sourse\course_prj\course9_seg1\course9_seg1\seg_1\src\div_clk.v":30:4:30:9|Found inferred clock pll|clkout_inferred_clock which controls 25 sequential elements including u_div_clk.times_cnt[23]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
