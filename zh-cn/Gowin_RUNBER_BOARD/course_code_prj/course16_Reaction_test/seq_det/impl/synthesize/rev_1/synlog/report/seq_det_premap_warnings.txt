@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: MT529 :"j:\source_bac\gowin_runber_board\course_code_prj\course16_reaction_test\seq_det\src\btn_deb.v":35:4:35:9|Found inferred clock lock_top|clk which controls 156 sequential elements including U_btn_deb.time_cnt[17]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
